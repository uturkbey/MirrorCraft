# MirrorCraft
A JAVA desktop application that mainly implements basic ray tracing algorithms and is supported with graphical user interface for 2-D visualization/simulation of optical behaviors of flat/curved mirrors and lenses under excitation of light beams.

Understanding the optic and the behavior of the light has always been a struggling process for students because of the lack of chance to create a vivid demonstration of optic systems on board or paper. MirrorCraft targets to make users learn how to use the optical concepts like prisms, mirrors, lenses, the behavior of the light beams and practice the optic laws of physics while having fun and challenging themselves. Beside individual benefits, teachers will also have a chance to give the students an image of optic systems.
